	<div class="text">
	<span style="color:#E51636">Mary of Tequesta, Florida - March 2, 2018</span><br />
	“I enjoy their chick filet sandwich and desserts. Their customer service is excellent. Other restaurants should take heed on how to deal with their clients.”<br />
	<br />
	<span style="color:#E51636">Janet of Richmond, VA - March 1, 2018</span><br />
	“I love the food and service at Chick-fil-A. The food is always very good and my order is 	always correct. If I go through the drive-through, it always moves very quickly. If I go inside, I always find very friendly staff. It seems like they all enjoy working there.”<br />
	<br />
	<span style="color:#E51636">Deedee of Charleston, SC - Feb. 25, 2018</span><br />
	“Happy people, clean store, good service, clean restrooms, and good food. They move people 	through at an amazing rate. When I travel I know I can get a great meal at a reasonable price.”<br />
	<br />
	<span style="color:#E51636">Dale of Tucson, AZ - Feb. 21, 2018</span><br />
	“The staff is always very polite and caring. The staff is as fast as they can be so the wait is not terrible. If dining in they bring your order to where you are sitting. My only complaint would be the long lines in the drive-thru. That just goes to show how good they are.”<br />
	<br />
	<span style="color:#E51636">Pam of Lancaster, Kentucky - Jan. 5, 2018</span><br />
	“It was decent remembering it was fast food. I met a friend and had what else but fried chicken. The chicken was warm and crispy when it arrived. The salad appeared freshly made. It was a good experience.”<br />
	<br />
	<span style="color:#E51636">Norma of Winston Salem, NC - Dec. 30, 2017</span><br />
	“Chick-fil-A has a 100% rating for me due to many factors involving cleanliness. Not only from the way their employees handle their food but they also periodically change their oil to ensure freshness and making it healthy for their customers. You can tell the difference when the oil is not fresh as it reflects a stale taste on the foods. Chick-fil-A does not do this. They are also cognizant of making sure each customer is served fresh food daily.”
